## Intended Learning Outcome (ILO)

After taking this session you should be able to:

- distinguish between natural systems and man made systems.
- with regard to systems, describe the differences between the sciences, engineering and software development.

## Introduction

I am going to provide a quick definition of what a system is but I don't expect you to understand it right now.

> **System** - A system is a set (grouping/composition) of two or more interacting objects that form an integrated whole with a purpose.

> “A \[system is a\] whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without losing its essential characteristics as a whole”. (Ackoff, 1981, pp. 64-65)

That kinda seems simple enough, but really understanding what systems are about is a lot more than just memorising a few definitions. So, let's look at a few examples.

## Examples of Systems








## Assignments

1. In your own words, and with regards to systems, how does engineering, the sciences and software development differ.  

2. Create two lists
    - a list of natural systems
    - a list of man made systems  

3. Consider social systems like human interaction.
    - Is this a natural system or a man made system?
    - Where does ethics fall in-to all of this?
    - How about culture?
