## Intended Learning Outcome (ILO)

After taking this session you should be able to:

- distinguish between natural systems and man made systems.
- with regard to systems, describe the differences between the sciences, engineering and software development.

## Introduction

I am going to provide a quick definition of what a system is but I don't expect you to understand it right now.

> **System** - A system is a set (grouping/composition) of two or more interacting objects that form an integrated whole with a purpose.

> “A \[system is a\] whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without losing its essential characteristics as a whole”. (Ackoff, 1981, pp. 64-65)

That kinda seems simple enough, but there is a lot more to systems than a few definitions. Let's look at a few examples and then talk about systems.

## Types of Systems

There are two main types of systems: natural systems and manmade systems.

### Natural Systems Example

Natural systems are systems that exist in nature. They were not created by people. *Image-1* shows some examples of natural systems.

<div class="figure">
<p><img alt='Examples of natural systems.' src='/assets/img/systemExampleNatural.jpg' /></p>
<p>Image-1: Examples of natural systems.</p>
</div>

I say examples, plural, because this image contains more than one natural system. The tree in the foreground is a system. The forest in the background is a system.

What makes me say these are systems? Let's consider the tree. It has a trunk, needles/leaves and sap (among other things). These are the parts of the tree that, as a whole, form that tree. These parts work together so the tree can survive. Survival may be a purpose of that tree. If any of those parts were to be removed, the tree would not be able to survive.

If you look back up at the definition of a system, it may start to make more sense. As a quick exercise, try considering the forest as a system. What are it's parts? How do they work together. What is it's purpose?

### Manmade Systems Example

Manmade systems are systems created by people. They did not exist in nature before there were people. *Image-2* shows some examples of man made systems.

<div class="figure">
<p><img alt='Examples of manmade systems.' src='/assets/img/systemExampleManmade.jpg' /></p>
<p>Image-2: Examples of manmade systems.</p>
</div>

Again, I say examples, plural, because there is more than 1 man made system in the above picture. The roads, buildings, motorcycles, cars and even the city are all man made systems. There are even a few natural systems in *Image-2*: trees and people.

Let's consider the road as a system. It contains a road, bikes, pedestrians, cross-walks, and cars (among other things). These parts work together so things can move from one place to another place: potentially one purpose of a road system.

Let's check some of the parts of our system to see if we "cannot be divided into independent parts without losing its essential characteristics as a whole". If we remove the cars, bikes and people from our road system, then the road system can no longer transport anything. So, these seem to be parts that are necessary.

How about the cross walks. Are they necessary? If we remove them, can we still move things from one place to another place? Probably. So, are they really essential? For the stated purpose they are not necessary. However, what if we said the purpose of a road is to transport something from one place to another place as safely as possible?

I hope you can begin to appreciate how difficult it is to decide if something is a system or not.

## Disciplines of Systems - Introduced

We've covered two types of systems: natural and manmade. We can also consider systems based on disciplines:
- scientists
- engineers
- mathematics/IT
- social systems.

Each of these disciplines approach understanding systems differently. We could have an entire session on each of these disciplines. However, this is just an introduction

### Scientists and Systems

Scientists observe natural systems.

### Mathematics/IT and Systems

Mathematicians try to describe natural systems using mathematics. It is interesting to note that mathematics is a manmade system. It's purpose is to describe the universe. Information technology, and specifically, writing software is

### Social Systems




## Assignments

1. In your own words, and with regards to systems, how does engineering, the sciences and software development differ.
2. Create two lists
    - a list of natural systems
    - a list of man made systems
3. Consider social systems like human interaction.
    - Is this a natural system or a man made system?
    - Where does ethics fall in-to all of this?
    - How about culture?
4. Think about a car and all the parts contained within a car.
    - Choose a specific high end car and come up with a purpose for that car.
    - Create a list of car parts based on a car whose only purpose is to get from point a to point b.
    - Compare the above two cars.
