## Intended Learning Outcome (ILO)

After taking this session you should be able to:

- distinguish between natural systems and man made systems.
- with regard to systems, describe the differences between the sciences, engineering and software development.

## Introduction

I am going to provide a quick definition of what a system is but I don't expect you to understand it right now.

> **System** - A system is a set (grouping/composition) of two or more interacting objects that form an integrated whole with a purpose.

> “A \[system is a\] whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without losing its essential characteristics as a whole”. (Ackoff, 1981, pp. 64-65)

That kinda seems simple enough, but there is a lot more to systems than a few definitions. Let's look at a few examples and then talk about systems.

## Examples of Systems

There are two main types of systems: natural systems and manmade systems.

### Natural Systems Example

Natural systems are systems that exist in nature. They were not created by people. *Image-1* shows some examples of natural systems.

<div class="figure">
<p><img alt='Examples of natural systems.' src='/assets/img/systemExampleNatural.jpg' /></p>
<p>Image-1: Examples of natural systems.</p>
</div>

I say examples, plural, because this image contains more than one natural system. The tree in the foreground is a system. The forest in the background is a system.

What makes me say these are systems? Let's consider the tree. It has a trunk, needles/leaves and sap (among other things). These are the parts of the tree that, as a whole, form that tree. These parts work together so the tree can survive. Survival may be a purpose of that tree. If any of those parts were to be removed, the tree would not be able to survive.

If you look back up at the definition of a system, it may start to make more sense. As a quick exercise, try considering the forest as a system. What are it's parts? How do they work together. What is it's purpose?

### Manmade Systems Example

Manmade systems are systems created by people. They did not exist in nature before there were people. *Image-2* shows some examples of man made systems.

<div class="figure">
<p><img alt='Examples of manmade systems.' src='/assets/img/systemExampleManmade.jpg' /></p>
<p>Image-2: Examples of manmade systems.</p>
</div>

Again, I say examples, plural, because there is more than 1 man made system in the above picture. The roads, buildings, motorcycles, cars and even the city are all man made systems. There are even a few natural systems in *Image-2*: trees and people.

Let's consider the road as a system. It contains a road, bikes, pedestrians, cross-walks, and cars (among other things). These parts work together so things can move from one place to another place: potentially one purpose of a road system I would guess. If we remove the cars, bikes and people


## Assignments

1. In your own words, and with regards to systems, how does engineering, the sciences and software development differ.  

2. Create two lists
    - a list of natural systems
    - a list of man made systems  

3. Consider social systems like human interaction.
    - Is this a natural system or a man made system?
    - Where does ethics fall in-to all of this?
    - How about culture?
