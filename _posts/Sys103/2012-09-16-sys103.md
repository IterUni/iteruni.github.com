## Intended Learning Outcome (ILO)

After taking this session you should be able to:

- describe which disciplines use physical and/or modelled systems
- describe different system frameworks.

## Prerequisites

- 

## Introduction


## Frameworks


### Closed Systems

transfer of energy and information between boundary of system.

### Open Systems

continually interacting with environment: exchange materials, energy and information.

### Isolated Systems

nothing crosses the boundary. The universe might be isolated? If truly isolated, could we see it?

## Physical and Modelled Systems

### Physical Systems


### Modelled Systems

## Emergent Behaviour
