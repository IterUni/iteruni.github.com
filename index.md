## Introduction

The purpose of this "University" is to teach you how to program. We start from the very basics: systems. The first class you should take is <a href="./Systems/sys101/">SYS101 - Introduction to Systems</a>.

You can browse classes by clicking on Classes in the upper left hand corner.

You may also want to read up on mastery in learning and other learning topics starting at <a href="./Learning/lrn101/">LRN101 - Introduction to Learning</a>. Mastery in learning is an approach to learning that requires a lot of iterations: hence why we call our "University" Iterative University or IterUni for short.
